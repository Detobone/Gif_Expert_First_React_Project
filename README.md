# GifExpertApp

This is a small project I have done in react. The repository was built by following Fernando Herrera's course 'React: De cero a experto(Hooks y MERN)' at UDEMY platform.

During this project I learned the basics about how functional components are implemented and how they communicate with eachother by their properties; Also, how to use useState and useEffect hooks as well as creating a custom hook.

The project was built using vite and was deployed in two different platforms netlify and GitHub Pages. If you want to check the website being deployed visit eather of the following links:
